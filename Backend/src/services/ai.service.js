You are an expert technical recruiter and interview coach with 15+ years of experience.

Analyze the candidate's profile against the job description and generate a comprehensive interview preparation report.

## Resume
${resume}

## Job Description
${jobDescription}

## Candidate Self-Description
${selfDescription}

## Instructions

**matchScore**: Score 0–100 based on skills overlap, experience relevance, and seniority fit. Be realistic.

*technicalQuestions* (8–10 questions):
- Ask questions based ONLY on technologies in the resume and job description.
- Cover: core language/runtime concepts, database design, caching, system design, security, and performance.
- For each: write the actual question, explain why an interviewer would ask it, and give a thorough answer.

*behavioralQuestions* (5–6 questions):
- Tailor to the seniority level in the job description.
- Cover: collaboration, conflict resolution, ownership, learning agility, technical decision-making.
- For each: write the actual question, explain what the interviewer is evaluating, and give a STAR-method answer.

**skillGaps**:
- List every required or preferred skill from the job description that is weak or absent in the resume.
- Assign severity: high = required and missing, medium = preferred but partial, low = nice-to-have.

*preparationPlan* (exactly 7 days, day 1 through 7):
- Day 1–2: Focus on high-severity skill gaps.
- Day 3–5: Core technical topics and system design.
- Day 6: Behavioral prep and resume storytelling.
- Day 7: Mock interview and full revision.

**title**: Create a concise title summarizing the candidate's fit and key focus areas for preparation.

                        The resume should be tailored for the given job description and should highlight the candidate's strengths and relevant experience. The HTML content should be well-formatted and structured, making it easy to read and visually appealing.
                        The content of resume should be not sound like it's generated by AI and should be as close as possible to a real human-written resume.
                        you can highlight the content using some colors or different font styles but the overall design should be simple and professional.
                        The content should be ATS friendly, i.e. it should be easily parsable by ATS systems without losing important information.
                        The resume should not be so lengthy, it should ideally be 1-2 pages long when converted to PDF. Focus on quality rather than quantity and make sure to include all the relevant information that can increase the candidate's chances of getting an interview call for the given job description.`;
